								<p>I currently serve as a Part-Time Logistics and Event Facilitator at Certis Cisco in Singapore, where I am responsible for the data entry and storage of confiscated items throughout the island. My duties include maintaining accuracy and confidentiality, essential for investigative purposes. Additionally, I coordinated the secure distribution of national level examination papers across Singapore with Auxiliary Police Officers, ensuring that logistical operations adhere to stringent security protocols. My work at Certis Cisco has sharpened my abilities in handling sensitive information and orchestrating complex logistical tasks efficiently.</p>

								<p>Previously, I held the position of Part-Time Cash Management Officer at Certis Cisco, where I was tasked with the collection, verification, and processing of deposited packets. I meticulously calculated and matched values with deposit slips, identified discrepancies, and performed data entry under strict procedural guidelines. This role not only demanded a keen attention to detail but also a strong adherence to security measures to ensure the integrity of the financial processes. My capacity to manage financial transactions and maintain data integrity highlights my multifaceted skill set in financial management and secure operations.</p>
